    <p> What we MIGHT need to make this work:</p>
    <p>Array/list: to tell computer what the options are</p>
    <p>Loops: to repeat steps 5,6, and 7</p>
    <p>If/else statements: to either determine the winner of the overall game or winner of the round</p>
    <p>Alerts: to warn players of final round (or to count to 3, JUST an idea)</p>
    <p>prompts: to ask the user what they component they choose</p>
